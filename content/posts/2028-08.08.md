I built a nice publishing pipeline... but also left a velvet rope in front of it. A quiet fear that if you publish something personal, imperfect, or experimental it might be judged. But here's the thing: the best writing on the internet is written as if nobody is reading, so...

1. Write posts in a way that _you_ are the main audience. Date them so that they feel like journal entries.
2. Publish "small and unimportant" on purpose -- a paragraph, a note, a quote you like, a photo with one line of context.
3. Looking "smart" online is boring. Looking _human_ is memorable.
4. Jot down one thing each day that is a "[storyworthy](https://www.amazon.com/Storyworthy-Engage-Persuade-through-Storytelling/dp/1608685489)" moments -- odd encounters, tiny frustrations, small joy. You don't have to make them polished essays. Just write them down.

Treat it like a habit. It's not about perfection, it's about consistency. Start small, start simple, and start now.
