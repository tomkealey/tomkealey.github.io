Until lately, we would wrap up an iteration with a demo and a retro. It seemed the logical thing to do and we'd been doing it that way for ages. 

**Rules are made to be broken.** Now, we hold the retro on the penultimate day of the iteration. And while there's no reduction in the number of meetings, the run in to the finish feels gentler and the retro feels fresher which is perfect for a creative space.

Sometimes it's the small things that can make a difference.
